# mtaPriorityAffinity

This script detects a running "gta_sa.exe" process and adjusts priority and affinity settings automatically so that the game (MTA) appears less laggy and does not require prolonged "warm-up" after starting it up.

## Installation

1. Download the ZIP archive: [Click](https://github.com/xSimas/mtaPriorityAffinity/releases/download/v1.0.0/mtaPriorityAffinity.zip)
2. Extract the folder `mtaPriorityAffinity` onto your Windows Desktop and make sure that it stays there.
3. Move the file `mtaPriorityAffinity-amd.vbs` to your Windows Startup folder. Usually, it's located in: `C:\Users\{User}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
4. Sign-out and sign-in to your Windows account. The script should now be running as a background process.

## Future Releases

A solution for Windows-Intel systems still needs to be written.
